"A UMC era with the races in the add-ons Bad Moon Rising & Trinity.  Includes the factions in standard Archaic Era, as well as:\n"
"\n"
" Menagerie (UMC) - Conglomerate of enemies from SP Campaign Trinity.  The overall theme is... weird and alien, hopefully entertaining.\n"

" South-Seas (UMC) - Humans from lands to the south of Weldyn and the known realm of Wesnoth.  They got where they did by sailing the high seas.\n"

" Primeval (UMC)* - An arrogant, militant, and somewhat hedonistic race that predated the humans, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orcs, and had battled the ancestors of those modern races.  \n"
"\n"
" Phantom (UMC)* - An ancient and powerful civilization from long, long ago, that was defeated and enthralled by an alien invader.  \n"

"*NOTE: Phantom and Primeval factions are overpowered, and not included in Random Faction options."

"Long, long ago, there was a powerful empire, founded by the ruthless but wise Astragartesh of Horajha.  Horajha was a small island, far to the south of any lands known to the much more recent kingdom of Wesnoth.  Astragartesh and a small band of followers left Horajha in a fleet of canoes, to arrive at the shores of the Thrascic Kingdom.  There are no records of what happened, but somehow, Astragartesh gained control of the kingdom.  Neighboring kingdoms and tribes were quickly brought under Astragertesh's thumb - valiant warriors were not able to stand up to Astragartesh's forces because of some special edge they possessed.  The enemies of Astragartesh called it black magic; their leaders would die mysteriously, and their fighters were subjected to dazzling and ennervating sights.  It was not long before Astragartesh had laid claim to the entire southern continent he had made landfall with his canoe so many years before.\n"
"\n"
"As impressive as his conquest had been, the real genius of Astragartesh was his attention to his legacy.  The powers that he had used to achieve his successes were enshrined in something resembling a theocracy - a blending of religious dogma and legal code.  The empire he established was thus not dependent upon individuals, and it lived long after Astragartesh no longer walked the earth.\n"
"\n"
"The Astragartan Empire was almost a force of nature, nothing and no one in the southern hemishpere could even dream of challenging it.  But one day, something from far away, something not even of this world, paid a visit.  This outsider was bent upon destruction, and so the Astragartan Empire rallied its forces to remove the threat.  In the long and confusing war that followed, the Astragartan Empire learned that it was not the only side capable of using 'black magic'.  It was only about three years before the entire Empire had been brought under the thumb of this outsider, this one that was known as 'Destroyer'.  The once proud Astragartan Empire had become the cursed spirit army of this Destroyer, and it was fortunate for all subsequent generations of the world that the Empire forces were successfully banished to the empty 'dark realm' along with the last Emperor and incarnation of the Destroyer:  Seth.\n"

"The Primeval forces are beings from a time long, long ago. They share many traits of the modern races, it is possible that they are ancestors.\n"
"<header>text='History'</header>\n"
"In their time, they were engaged in an exceptionally grim war with an enemy both powerful and mysterious.  The enemy was defeated, but the devastation to the world was severe and many Primeval leaders decided it best to go into a form of suspended animation.\n"
"\n"
"Ages later, the Primevals re-emerged and encountered the modern races.  All differences might have been overcome, but approximately 50 years after the Primeval re-emergance came a plage.\n"
"\n"
"A strange disease of the soul and mind broke out, and denizens of the world became something else - something that called itself Khthon.  As all other races fell victim to the Khthon, the Primevals rose in strength, for they were immune.  In the ensueing war against the Khthon, the Primevals developed a distrust and hatred of all other races, for any of their member could be Khthon infiltrator.\n"
"\n"
"Records of how the war was resolved are lost, but ultimately we know it was the younger races who had triumphed.  Many of the Primevals had foreseen this, and had once again gone into suspended animation within their aging facilities.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Technology'</header>\n"
"The Primevals had never really mastered magic to the extent that the modern races have.  However, they did figure ways to harness it for a power source, and were able to easily mine and forge metals, fertilizers, and reactive chemicals; resources were unlimited.  Many of the modern races would have simply enjoyed a population explosion, but the austere Primeval culture led to something else.  Many feats of engineering were the result.  The downside of the rapid development was that the technological advances were uneven (roads, guns, aeroplanes, and many other things had simply never been imagined) and they all rested upon a power source no one understood:  that which some call 'magic'.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"The Primeval social order is very rigid, but merit-based.  The leaders are near god-like in their physical strength and prowess, but do not simply rule through a strong arm and stone heart.  Treachery to another Primeval is one of the most dishonourable acts one can engage in, so while all subordinates look upon their superiors with fear, they know those superiors have earned their rank and will neither betray nor toy with them.  The result is a disciplined and efficient military force, but the society lacks creativity and can become too focussed upon narrow goals.\n"
"\n"
"As a result of both the rigid meritocracy and the abundance of resources, the Primevals lost whatever ideas about gender roles they once had.  In general, the roles requiring strength fall to the males while roles requiring endurance fall to the females, but either sex can become a leader and both sexes are expected to engage in combat."

While there are some cultural differences, they have a common belief in various gods who are constantly in a struggle with each other.  This struggle explains the mystery, joy, chaos, and misery of life.\n"
"<header>text='Legends'</header>\n"
"According to South-Seas beliefs, the struggle of the gods roughly falls into two factions.  One is led by Aruyun and Ishtu, the golden-crowned god of day and winged god of victory, respectively.  The other is led by Athtep, the red-eyed god of night, and Nura, the shrouded god of death.  While night and death are to be feared, they are not evil and neither godly faction can ever triumph.  \n"
"\n"
"Legends passed down through many generations do speak of a time when there was a great evil.  The name of this evil has been forgotten, for the older generations were reluctant to utter it.  The evil was motivated by neither chaos nor death, but rather the complete annihilation of all.  Aruyun, Athtep, and all of the gods of the world united to defeat this evil, splitting it into two components much like they themselves were divided.  One half was a cold, lifeless, and listless force that bore a strong resemblance to death.  The other half was passionate and full of life, but lacked direction and was much weakened without the cold logic of the other half.  The enemy was now split into components that fit within the understanding of the world; it was of this world, and could not carry out its original mission.  There is always a fear that the two parts could re-unite, but most modern South-Seafarers do not really believe these tales."

Surrounded by hostile orcs, they needed to develop stratagies for survival that did not involve vast resources or brute strength, but rather rapid communication and mobiliziation. Every man and woman had to be able to survive an orcish assault, so there was no time for studying. However, with their recent reacquaintance with the people of Wesnoth, they have just started training mages."
