License
-------

The add-on's source code, artwork, and sound assets are provided under
the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, or (at your option) any
later version, under the same terms as the main BfW project.


Note: The artwork will most likely be released under CC-BY-SA, but there is a fraction that is derivative 
of artwork from the BfW project, so there are some conflicts to work out first.


Installing
----------

This add-on is best installed through the BfW add-on interface.  Please see the BfW help for more information.
